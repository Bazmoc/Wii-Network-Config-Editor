# Wii-Network-Config-Editor
This Wii homebrew program allows you to change your Wifi Settings without going to the Wii Menu. Especially useful for portable consoles that haven't got a bluetooth module.

WARNING : This program makes permanent changes to the NAND, use (and/or modify) at your own risks.
Please make a NAND Backup before using my program, just in case.

## What is this program and what it does:

This program is a Wifi settings editor designed especially for Portable Wiis that cannot access the Wii menu to change Network settings.

However it works fine with normal Wii's also (if you are too lazy to go to the wii menu or you can't access it for some reason).

This program changes the SSID, Password, and security type of the network configuration file named "config.dat" located at /shared2/sys/net/02/config.dat on the NAND.
